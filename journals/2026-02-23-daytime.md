# Daytime Check-In (Integrated System)

Date: 2026-02-23
Check-in: Daytime
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model (unchanged): `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

## 1) Carryover + Prior-Night Plan Baseline
- Prior evening tomorrow-plan baseline available: No explicit baseline captured.
- Baseline summary from prior evening: Not available in this update.
- Reality-day changes since last night: intentional extra recovery (skipped masters swim), slower start.
- Prior evening missed or unresolved follow-up present: Unknown.
- Carryover items to resolve now: none explicit.

## 2) Current Status Snapshot
- Recovery readiness now: Yellow (decent overall, low activation on wake).
- Energy now: ~3/5 (started slow, now productive enough for work/side-hustle tasks).
- Stress now + reset status: Not explicitly rated.
- Hydration status right now: low intake reported so far (coffee; no clear water total yet).
- Nutrition status right now: 1 coffee + sugar + splash half-and-half; appetite low; lunch packed and planned for later; dinner planned with parents.
- Training status now: completed 3 commercial-break kettlebell rounds (40s on/20s off) with mild soreness; planning one more kettlebell workout tonight.
- Training mode token: `Train:HomeStrength` (kettlebell-focused), with recovery bias.

## 3) Schedule Constraints
- Hard constraints for rest of day: wants lower-activity recovery vibe; family dinner; still wants to move needle on work.
- Biggest friction right now: low appetite and low initial activation after oversleep.

## 4) Remainder-of-Day Execution Plan
1) Drink water in two blocks before dinner (first block now, second block late afternoon).
2) Eat packed lunch when home (even if split into smaller portions if appetite is low).
3) Complete one capped kettlebell session tonight (short quality session, recovery-biased) before winding down.
4) Family dinner: protein-forward plate + simple carbs + veg.
5) Early bed routine after dinner and final wrap-up check.

## 5) Top Risk + Fallback
- Top risk that could break execution: appetite + low drive leading to under-fueling and skipping evening session.
- If-then fallback: If appetite stays low, do a smaller protein-first meal and keep kettlebell to a 10-12 minute minimum block.
- Fallback rung for today: `C` (Minimum Day 8-12 min) if soreness or motivation drops.

## 6) Pepper Coach Response
- Daytime coaching read:
  - Smart recovery pivot. You still got productive output and movement in, which is exactly how to recover without drifting.
- Next 1-3 actions for remainder of day (baseline-adjusted):
  1) Hydration push now.
  2) Eat packed lunch before dinner.
  3) One short kettlebell finish tonight, then early wind-down.

## In-day nutrition update (later)
- Added intake:
  - 1 blueberry oat Kodiak breakfast bar
  - ham + swiss sandwich:
    - ~6 thin slices ham
    - 4 thin slices swiss
    - ~2 tbsp olive-oil mayo
    - ~2 tbsp honey mustard
  - ~200 ml Coke
  - 1 Ratio Protein Key Lime Pie cup
- Practical read: appetite moved from low to active, which reduces under-fueling risk for tonight.

## Follow-up needed for complete log
- Stress rating (1-5).
- Water total by evening.
- One before-bed goal + time.
