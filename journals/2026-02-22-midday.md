Date: 2026-02-22
Check-in: Midday

- Morning food: McDonald’s steak/egg/cheese sandwich + Coke.
- Hydration so far: ~300 ml water logged.
- Movement: walk + wood help earlier; no additional training yet today.
- Nicotine/anxiety: 3 vape hits; ~2 hours anxiety, then redirected into room cleaning + laundry.
- Intent for today: relax/recover, do 1 HIIT round later, then early bed after dinner.

## Required fields still needing follow-up
- Readiness color + current energy (1-5).
- Stress now (1-5) + 10-minute reset done/scheduled time.

- Pain score (0-10) + location + red-flag symptom yes/no.
- Meaningful 10+ minute connection done/planned + with who.
- One concrete next action + start time.

## Pepper Coach Response (required)
- Midday coaching read:
  - Good self-regulation move: you redirected anxious energy into productive cleanup. Big lever now is hydration and execution timing so the day doesn’t drift.

- Next 1-3 actions for today:
  1) Drink 700 ml water in the next 60-90 min (to reach 1L baseline quickly).
  2) Set a hard HIIT start time and run one round (fallback = 8-12 min Minimum Day if late).
  3) Keep dinner protein + veg centered and shut down early for better sleep carryover.
