# Daytime Check-In (Integrated System)

Date: 2026-02-24
Check-in: Daytime
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model (unchanged): `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

## 1) Carryover + Prior-Night Plan Baseline
- Prior evening tomorrow-plan baseline available: No.
- Baseline summary from prior evening: Not captured; recovered from user message directly.
- Reality-day changes since last night: slept decently but woke sluggish/cozy; delayed rise until ~9:00.
- Prior evening missed or unresolved follow-up present: Yes (stress/water/bedtime closure now captured).
- Carryover/baseline update resolved in this touch: Partial (captured most closure metrics).

## 2) Current Status Snapshot
- Recovery readiness now: Green.
- Energy now: ~3.5-4/5.
- Stress now: ~1-2/5.
- Hydration status right now: coffee only, no water yet.
- Nutrition status right now: no food yet; plan to snack at pool (yogurt + mozzarella/salami sticks + kombucha).
- Training status now: likely no formal workout today due schedule; leaning recovery/minimum day.
- Training mode token: `Train:Recovery` (fallback `Train:MinimumDay` if possible).

## 3) Schedule Constraints
- Hard constraints for rest of day:
  - work block until ~4:30pm
  - coaching 1:00-2:00pm and 4:30-6:55pm
  - home ~7:30pm
- Biggest friction right now: low fueling/hydration start + compressed day.

## 4) Remainder-of-Day Execution Plan
1) Immediate hydration: drink water before first coaching block.
2) Pool snack block before/around 1:00pm: yogurt + mozzarella/salami sticks + kombucha.
3) Add one additional water block between coaching sessions.
4) Recovery-bias day: if no full workout, complete minimum movement (8-12 min mobility/bodyweight) after getting home.
5) Evening close: protein-forward dinner + early wind-down.

## 5) Top Risk + Fallback
- Top risk that could break execution: under-fueling and dehydration during split coaching schedule.
- If-then fallback: if schedule compresses, prioritize grab-and-go protein + water first, then minimum 8-12 min movement at home.
- Fallback rung for today: `C`.

## 6) Pepper Coach Response
- Daytime coaching read:
  - This is a smart recovery/setup day. Keep energy stable with hydration + simple protein timing and don’t force a big workout.
- Next 1-3 actions for remainder of day (baseline-adjusted):
  1) 500-700ml water before/through first pool block.
  2) Eat planned pool snack (protein-first).
  3) Minimum-day movement tonight if time/energy permit.

## Follow-up needed for complete evening scoring
- Approximate total water by bed.
- Final nutrition/training completion details after 7:30pm.
- Before-bed goal + exact start time.
