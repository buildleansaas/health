# Midday Check-In (Sleep System)

Date: 2026-02-19
Check-in: Midday

## Current State
- Energy now (1-5): 4
- Stress now (1-5): 2-3
- Focus now (1-5): 3

## Adherence Status
- Caffeine cutoff still on track: Yes so far (coffee at ~11:00am; cutoff target 2:00pm)
- Last meal cutoff still on track: Plan is yes (nothing after 7:00pm)
- Light or movement completed: Yes (coaching + walking back and forth ~1 hour on feet)

## Course Correction
- Biggest risk this afternoon or evening: forgetting to eat before 4:30 coaching or eating late after 7
- One adjustment for tonight: meal at ~2:15pm (Chipotle) + hard stop on food after 7; no screens after ~8:30–9:00pm
- Accountability action (when or how): set a 7:00pm “kitchen closed” reminder + put caffeine-free soda front-of-fridge if you want one with dinner

## Notes (optional)
- Concern: not sleeping well tonight → groggy for tomorrow morning.
