# Afternoon Check-In (Integrated System)

Date: 2026-02-21
Check-in: Afternoon
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

## Required (fast)
- Energy now (1-5): ~3-4 (functional, got distracted)
- Stress now (1-5) + reset done/scheduled: Low-moderate; no formal reset logged
- Hydration progress so far (estimated liters + on-track yes/no): 0.9L; improving but still a bit behind
- Nutrition update since midday (short): No meaningful meals logged since earlier burrito
- Training status now (done / pending / fallback / recovery): Done baseline movement; optional extra pending
- Training type now (Train token): `Train:MinimumDay` (1-hour walk + wood work); considering `Train:HIITOnly` later tonight
- Risk check: pain (0-10), location, red-flag symptom (yes/no): Mouth/throat irritation improving with hydration; red-flag = No
- Biggest friction this afternoon: Coding distraction / execution drift on non-negotiables
- One concrete action + time for next 2-3 hours: Finalize and send PCBRVA plan update, then outline meal-prep plan for next week

## Optional
- Optional: Wants to do one HIIT session after dinner, then hot tub/recovery.

## Pepper Coach Response (required)
- Afternoon coaching read (1-2 lines):
  - Strong recovery signal: symptoms improved once hydration started. Biggest issue now is execution drift, not capacity.

- Next 1-3 actions to finish strong:
  1) Finish hydration to at least 1.5L total before bed.
  2) Send PCBRVA plan update before any additional coding.
  3) If energy is okay after dinner, do one short HIIT block, then hard-stop into recovery.

Unknown format: `Unknown - reason` (only if explicitly stated).
