# Evening Recap (Integrated System)

Date: 2026-02-20
Check-in: Evening
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

## Required Scores (Pepper-computed)
- Sleep score (0-4): 2
- Nutrition score (0-3): 1
- Training score (0-3): 2
- Total score (0-10): 5
- Training mode used + completion: Masters Swim (`Train:MastersSwim`) + planned

## Required Modifier Checks (not scored)
- Readiness trend today: Better
- Peak stress (1-5) + 10-min reset completed: 2/5 + No dedicated reset logged
- Hydration sufficiency (urine mostly pale + 1L by noon): No (reported dehydrated)
- Meaningful connection completed (10+ min): Yes (family + coworker conversations)
- Risk/safety: peak pain (0-10), location, red-flag symptom: 5, arms/upper body from breath-control swim work, No red-flag symptoms

## Required Reflection
- What happened (2 bullets):
- Completed planned masters swim session with ~1 hour breath-control work.
- Lifeguarded 12-5 and spent long blocks on computer for side-project work; eyes felt strained.

- What worked (1 bullet):
- Followed through on planned training and kept stress relatively low despite workload.

- Friction (1 bullet):
- Hydration and food quality slipped (low water intake, higher sugar/fried foods), plus high screen load.

- One change for tomorrow:
- Front-load hydration early (at least 1.5L by early afternoon) and do a short recovery block before bed.

## Nutrition Notes (from Austin)
- Breakfast: grande Starbucks coffee + 2 sausage/egg/cheese sandwiches
- Snacks: kombucha, 0.5L sweet tea, Greek Gods honey yogurt, mozzarella + salami rolls
- Dinner: fried rice, beef & broccoli, sweet/sour + hot mustard, crab rangoons, ice cream
- Other: indica pen 3x

## Pepper Coach Report (required)
- Why (wins + score drag):
  - Wins: planned masters swim complete, low-moderate stress, strong social connection, no red-flag symptoms.
  - Score drag: clear hydration miss, high processed/sugary intake late day, long screen exposure with eye strain.

- Insightful read (1-2 lines):
  - Today was high output with under-supported recovery inputs. Performance happened, but hydration/recovery lag can compound into next-day grogginess and weaker adaptation if repeated.

- Tomorrow improvement plan (top 3):
  1) Hydration front-load: 500ml on wake, 500ml mid-morning, 500ml by lunch (>=1.5L by early afternoon).
  2) Recovery block: 10-12 minutes (arm/shoulder mobility + slow breathing) and reduce screen brightness/time before bed.
  3) Nutrition cleanup: keep protein steady, but choose one treat vector (either sweet drink or dessert) instead of stacking both.

## Optional
- Cannabis: indica pen 3 hits.
