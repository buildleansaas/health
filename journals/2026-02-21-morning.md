# Morning Check-In (Integrated System)

Date: 2026-02-21
Check-in: Morning
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

## Required (fast)
- Recovery readiness: Mixed (mellow now, but anxiety/memory fuzz from cannabis)
- Energy (1-5): Good (~4/5)
- Wake window hit: Woke around 8:00am
- Sleep quality (1-5): Low (reported ~2/6; treat as poor sleep quality)
- Sleep guardrails today: not yet set in message
- Nutrition anchors + training mode + fallback:
  - Training type: `Train:MinimumDay`
  - Intention: Moderate minimum-day activity
  - Movement done: long walk (30-60 min) + stacked wood ~30 min
- Hydration kickoff: Still pending (no water yet at latest update)
- Nutrition update after check-in: Chick-fil-A breakfast burrito + 3 jalapeño salsa packs
- Stress now + reset: ~2-3/5 (possibly THC-related)
- Meaningful connection planned: Yes (hanging with brother/family)
- Risk check:
  - Pain: sore throat + mouth ulcers (inner cheek/lower tongue)
  - Red-flag symptom: No
- Biggest risk + if-then:
  - Risk: getting off-schedule and missing meaningful progress while socializing
  - If-then: if social time drifts, do a short reset and one concrete household task block
- One non-negotiable:
  - Clean house/truck/living space and handle household responsibilities

## Optional
- Context: THC this morning (2 vape hits + 2 blunt hits), mild anxiety and memory-recall discomfort.
- Bedroom was too hot despite open window.

## Pepper Coach Response (required)
- Morning coaching read (1-2 lines):
  - You already got movement and family connection wins. Main risk today is a slow drift from THC + no hydration/food start, which can amplify anxiety and reduce execution quality.

- Today's top 1-3 actions:
  1) Hydrate immediately: 500ml now, 500ml by late morning, 500ml by lunch.
  2) Nice job getting food in; keep next intake cleaner/lighter (protein + fruit/water) to reduce anxiety swing.
  3) Run one focused 45-minute household block (truck/space/responsibilities), then reassess.

Unknown format: `Unknown - reason` (only if explicitly stated).
