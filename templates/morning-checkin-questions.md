# Morning Check-In Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep tone short and practical.

1. "Morning check-in for today (local time)."
2. "Quick values: wake window hit, sleep quality (1-5), awakenings count, morning energy (1-5), mood/readiness (1-5)."
3. "Set sleep guardrails: caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, wind-down start."
4. "Set nutrition anchors for today: protein meals, hydration/salt plan, and carb strategy."
5. "What is your training plan (type + time)?"
6. "If training gets disrupted, what is your fallback minimum?"
7. "What is the biggest risk today, and what is your if-then response?"
8. "What is your one non-negotiable?"
9. "Optional: stress, schedule constraints, other notes?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
