## Required first
1. "Morning check-in (<90 sec). Reply in one line with readiness color, energy (1-5), wake window (Y/N), and sleep quality (1-5)."
2. "Add guardrails (caffeine cutoff / last meal cutoff / wind-down), plus nutrition + training mode token (`Train:GymLP|Train:HomeStrength|Train:HIITOnly|Train:MinimumDay|Train:Recovery`) and fallback rung (`A/B/C`)."
3. "Add hydration 1L-by-noon status (Y/N), stress (1-5) with 10-min reset time, and meaningful connection plan (Y/N + who)."
4. "Add pain (0-10) + location + red-flag symptom (Y/N), then biggest risk + if-then and one non-negotiable."
5. "Optional: awakenings, mood/readiness, schedule constraints."

Pre-swim nights (Sun/Tue/Thu): avoid late hard HIIT; if evening is tight, favor `A` or `C`.

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
