# Morning Check-In Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep tone short and coachy.

1. "Morning check-in for today (local time)."
2. "Quick values: wake window hit, sleep quality (1-5), night awakenings count, morning energy (1-5)."
3. "Set today's guardrails: caffeine cutoff time, last meal cutoff time, wind-down start time."
4. "What is your light or movement plan today?"
5. "What is the biggest risk to tonight's sleep?"
6. "What is one action you will take to reduce that risk?"
7. "Optional: stress, travel or schedule changes, other notes?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
