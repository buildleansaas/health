# Midday Check-In Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep it short and practical.

1. "Midday check-in for today."
2. "Rate energy, stress, and focus right now (1-5 each)."
3. "Are you still on track for caffeine cutoff and last meal cutoff?"
4. "Did you complete light or movement yet?"
5. "What is the biggest risk to tonight's sleep from here?"
6. "Name one adjustment you will make today."
7. "Optional: calendar pressure, social events, other notes?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
