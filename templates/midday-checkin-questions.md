# Midday Check-In Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep it short and actionable.

1. "Midday check-in for today."
2. "Rate energy, stress, focus, and hunger/cravings right now (1-5 each)."
3. "Are sleep guardrails still on track: caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, wind-down plan?"
4. "Are nutrition anchors on track?"
5. "Training status: done, pending, or fallback?"
6. "What is the biggest risk from now to bedtime?"
7. "Give one sleep adjustment, one nutrition adjustment, and one training/recovery adjustment."
8. "What is your accountability action and timing?"
9. "Optional: calendar pressure, social events, other notes?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
