# Daily Recap Questions (Pepper)

Use this exact sequence in Discord. Keep tone short and coachy.

1. "Quick daily recap. Is this for today or yesterday (your local time)?"
2. "Scorecard check (yes/no each): wake window, morning light, caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, room cool/dark/quiet, wind-down, sleep quality >=4/5."
3. "What happened today? Give me 3 short bullets."
4. "What worked today? 1-2 bullets."
5. "What sucked or created friction? 1-2 bullets."
6. "What is ONE change for tonight?"
7. "Optional: training, alcohol/cannabis, stress?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing part.
