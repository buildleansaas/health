# Evening Recap Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep tone short and coachy.

1. "Evening recap for the day that just ended (local time). If the date is unclear, give me the exact date."
2. "Scorecard check (yes or no each): wake window, morning light, caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, room cool/dark/quiet, wind-down, sleep quality >=4/5."
3. "What happened today? Give me 3 short bullets."
4. "What worked today? 1-2 bullets."
5. "What created friction? 1-2 bullets."
6. "What is ONE change for tomorrow?"
7. "Optional: training, alcohol or cannabis, stress?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
