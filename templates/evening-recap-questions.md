# Evening Recap Questions (Pepper)

Use this sequence in Discord. Keep tone short and coachy.

1. "Evening recap for the day that just ended (local time). If date is unclear, give exact date."
2. "Sleep score (0-4): wake window, caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, wind-down + sleep environment."
3. "Nutrition score (0-3): protein anchors, hydration/fueling consistency, whole-food pattern/seed-oil avoidance target."
4. "Training score (0-3): planned training or fallback, movement baseline, recovery block."
5. "What happened today? Give 3 short bullets."
6. "What worked? 1-2 bullets."
7. "What created friction? 1-2 bullets."
8. "What is ONE change for tomorrow?"
9. "Optional: symptoms/recovery notes, alcohol/cannabis, stress load?"

If anything is missing, ask only for the missing required item.
