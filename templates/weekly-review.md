# Weekly Review (Integrated System)

Week of:
Timezone: America/New_York

Scoring model: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.
Modifier facets (not score points): readiness, stress/reset, hydration, connection, risk/safety.
Training mode enum: `Masters Swim`, `Gym LP`, `Home Strength (KB+Pullup+Rings)`, `HIIT Only (Chris Heria style)`, `Minimum Day`, `Recovery`.
Mode token format: `Train:MastersSwim|Train:GymLP|Train:HomeStrength|Train:HIITOnly|Train:MinimumDay|Train:Recovery`.
Fallback ladder: `A = Home Strength 25-35 min`, `B = HIIT 10-15 min`, `C = Minimum Day 8-12 min`.
Pre-swim nights (Sun/Tue/Thu): avoid late hard HIIT; if evening is tight, favor `A` or `C`.

## Modifier Trigger Review (not scored)
- Readiness Yellow threshold met? (Yellow >=2 consecutive check-ins or energy <=2): yes / no
- Readiness Red threshold met? (any Red or energy = 1): yes / no
- Stress threshold met? (stress >=4 without same-window 10-min reset): yes / no
- Hydration threshold met? (dark urine or missed 1L by noon on >=2 days): yes / no
- Connection threshold met? (missed meaningful connection on >=2 consecutive days): yes / no
- Pain/red-flag escalation threshold met? (pain >=7 or red-flag yes, or pain 4-6 for >48h): yes / no
