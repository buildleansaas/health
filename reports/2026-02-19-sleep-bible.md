# Sleep Bible (Coach Version)

Date: 2026-02-19  
Audience: Austin  
Intent: Build life around sleep quality with high adherence and low drama.

## Executive Summary

- Protect one anchor first: consistent wake time 7 days/week (within +/-30 minutes).
- Get outdoor light early: 10-30 minutes within 60 minutes of waking.
- Use a bedtime alarm and a fixed wind-down; stop negotiating with yourself at night.
- Keep the room cool (around 18-19C if comfortable), dark, and quiet.
- Cut caffeine at least 8 hours before bed; 10 hours is better if you are sensitive.
- Keep last meal and big fluids at least 90 minutes before bed.
- Use naps only if needed: short (10-25 minutes), before 3:00 PM, consistent.
- Train and move during the day; avoid hard training too close to bedtime.
- If sleep duration is long but you wake unrefreshed (especially with snoring/gasping), screen for sleep apnea.
- Supplements are optional and secondary; behavior and schedule do most of the work.

## The System

### 1) Environment

- Bedroom setup:
  - Cool: aim for ~18-19C if comfortable.
  - Dark: blackout curtains, cover LEDs, no bright clock face.
  - Quiet: white noise or earplugs if environment is noisy.
- Bedding:
  - Weighted blanket can be tested if anxiety/restlessness is high.
  - Keep it optional; not a must-have.
- Devices:
  - Keep phone off the bed.
  - Use airplane mode or keep devices farther away if it reduces stress.
  - Ignore "orgonite/EMF detox" product claims; focus on practical exposure reduction.

### 2) Schedule

- Target landmarks (adjust to real life, keep sequence stable):
  - Wake: fixed daily.
  - Morning light: within 60 minutes of wake.
  - Last caffeine: 8-10 hours before bed.
  - Dinner finished: >=90 minutes before bed.
  - Wind-down alarm: 60 minutes before target sleep.
  - In-bed ready for sleep: around 10:00 PM.
  - Lights out: around 10:30 PM (or your aligned equivalent).
- Weekend rule:
  - Same wake time range (+/-30 minutes), not a social jet-lag rebound.

### 3) Daytime Anchors

- Morning:
  - Bright outdoor light and light movement.
  - Protein-forward breakfast if it helps appetite/energy stability.
- Midday:
  - Physical exertion most days (walks, training, labor, chores).
  - Keep hard sessions ending at least 2-3 hours before bedtime.
- Caffeine:
  - Practical default: stop by early afternoon (for most people).
  - If highly sensitive or anxious sleep: test a stricter cutoff (late morning).

### 4) Evening Shutdown

- 60-minute shutdown routine:
  - Dim lights and reduce screen brightness.
  - Avoid stimulating work, conflict, and doomscrolling.
  - Prepare next-day basics (clothes, first task, hydration).
  - Warm shower/bath 1-2 hours before bed can help onset.
- Light strategy:
  - Keep overhead lights low and warm.
  - Red/amber glasses are optional; useful if screens are unavoidable.
- Food/fluid:
  - No large meals, large fluids, or alcohol close to bedtime.

### 5) Napping Rules

- Use only if needed for function or recovery.
- Keep it short: 10-25 minutes.
- Keep it early: before 3:00 PM.
- Keep it consistent on nap days (same window).
- If naps reduce nighttime sleep drive, remove them for 7 days and reassess.

### 6) Posture

- Default: side sleeping is reasonable, especially for snoring/possible OSA.
- Left-side preference:
  - Can help some people (for reflux/comfort), but not universal.
  - Treat as a personal experiment, not a law of physics.
- Pillow support:
  - Keep neck neutral; avoid extreme flexion/extension.
  - Add knee or torso support if side sleeping increases comfort and reduces wake-ups.

  - Keep room cool after.
- Day 12:
  - Optional: trial one supplement only (not a stack).
  - Track effect for 3 nights before changing anything else.
- Day 13:
  - Screen for apnea flags: loud snoring, gasping, morning headaches, daytime sleepiness.
  - If flags present, plan clinical follow-up.
- Day 14:
  - Review score trends and subjective quality.
  - Keep top 3 habits; remove low-value complexity.
  - Set next 14-day targets.

## Do / Avoid Checklist

- Do:
  - Fixed wake time daily.
  - Early daylight exposure.
  - Consistent wind-down alarm.
  - Cool/dark/quiet bedroom.
  - Caffeine cutoff with enough runway.
  - Daytime movement and exertion.
  - Short, early naps only if needed.
  - Escalate for apnea signs.
- Avoid:
  - Weekend sleep schedule chaos.
  - Late caffeine and "just one more coffee."
  - Bright screens and overhead lights late night.
  - Heavy meals and big fluids right before bed.
  - Rebuilding your supplement stack every 48 hours.
  - Buying gadgets before fixing basics.

## Tracking: Daily Scorecard

- Track each day:
  - Sleep time (lights out)
  - Wake time
  - Morning sunlight (yes/no + minutes)
  - Caffeine cutoff hit (yes/no)
  - Last meal time
  - Room temperature range
  - Subjective sleep quality (1-5)
- Simple score:
  - 1 point each for: wake-time target, morning light, caffeine cutoff, last meal timing, room setup, wind-down completed, subjective quality >=4/5.
  - Total: 0-7 daily.
- Use template:
  - `templates/daily-scorecard.md`

## Risks / Claims Audit

### Stronger Evidence (high confidence)

- Consistent sleep-wake timing and morning light support circadian alignment.
- Evening bright light exposure delays melatonin and can worsen sleep onset.
- CBT-I is first-line for chronic insomnia.
- Caffeine consumed late in the day can impair sleep even 6 hours pre-bed.
- Sleep apnea should be evaluated when symptoms suggest it.

### Mixed or Context-Dependent (moderate confidence)

- Cool, dark, quiet rooms are generally helpful; exact temperature is individual.
- Warm shower/bath pre-bed can help some people fall asleep faster.
- Weighted blankets may help some people with insomnia/anxiety, but effects vary.
- Naps can improve alertness if short/early; long or late naps can backfire.
- Side sleeping can help some snoring/OSA cases; "left side for everyone" is too strong.

### Weak/Unsupported (low confidence)

- EMF/orgonite claims for sleep/lifespan are weak and not clinically reliable.
- Broad "longevity stack" claims from social media without robust trials.
- Milk + honey as a major sleep intervention (fine ritual, weak direct evidence).

### Safe Alternatives for Weak Claims

- Put phone away from bed, use airplane mode overnight if preferred, and disable notifications.
- Prioritize lighting, schedule regularity, and apnea screening before buying devices/supplements.

## Supplements (Optional, Secondary, Caution First)

- This is educational only, not medical advice.
- Check with a licensed clinician if Austin has chronic conditions, kidney/liver disease, mental health conditions, pregnancy/breastfeeding, or uses prescription meds.
- Introduce one supplement at a time for at least 3 nights before changing dose or adding another.

- Magnesium (often glycinate or L-threonate)
  - Typical trial: 100-300 mg elemental magnesium in the evening.
  - Cautions: GI upset; kidney disease risk; can interact with some antibiotics and other meds.

- Glycine
  - Typical trial: 3 g 30-60 minutes before bed.
  - Evidence: small studies suggest possible sleep quality benefit.
  - Cautions: possible GI upset; long-term high-dose data limited.

- L-theanine
  - Typical trial: 100-200 mg in the evening.
  - Evidence: modest stress/anxiety support; direct sleep effect is mixed.
  - Cautions: can add to sedation; may lower blood pressure in some people.

- Zinc
  - Typical trial if diet is low/deficiency risk: 5-15 mg with food.
  - Cautions: avoid chronic high intake; long-term >40 mg/day can cause copper deficiency and other issues.

- Thiamine / TTFD
  - Evidence for sleep-specific benefit is weak.
  - Typical use should stay conservative unless clinician-guided.
  - Cautions: product forms vary; quality and dosing claims are inconsistent.

- Melatonin (use sparingly, not as default nightly forever)
  - Typical trial: 0.3-1 mg, often 2-3 hours before target bedtime for circadian shift issues.
  - Best use case: jet lag, schedule shifts, delayed sleep timing.
  - Cautions: daytime grogginess; interaction risk with some medications; quality varies by brand.

- Milk + honey
  - Fine as a calming ritual for some people.
  - Keep portion small and not close to lights-out.
