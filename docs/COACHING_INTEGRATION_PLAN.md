# Coaching Integration Plan (Sleep + Nutrition + Training)

## Goal
- Replace sleep-only coaching with an integrated daily system.
- Keep prompts short, behavior-first, and easy to execute under real schedule pressure.
- Drive consistency, not perfection.

## Guiding rules
- Track three domains every day: sleep, nutrition, training.
- Prioritize adherence and trend direction over day-to-day perfection.
- Use one primary behavior change at a time.
- Keep coach language non-diagnostic and practical.

## Daily check-ins

### Morning check-in
- Capture recovery state:
- Sleep quality, wake-window hit, awakenings, morning energy.
- Set sleep guardrails:
- Caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, wind-down start.
- Set nutrition plan:
- Protein anchors, hydration/salt plan, carb timing strategy.
- Set training plan:
- Session type/time + fallback version.
- Set risk response:
- Biggest risk and one if-then plan.

### Midday check-in
- Re-rate current state:
- Energy, stress, focus, hunger/cravings.
- Confirm adherence status:
- Sleep guardrails still on track.
- Nutrition anchors on track.
- Training done / pending / fallback triggered.
- Apply course correction:
- One sleep correction, one nutrition correction, one training/recovery correction.
- Lock one accountability action by time.

### Evening recap
- Score the day with simple points.
- Capture what happened, what worked, and friction.
- Pick one change for tomorrow.
- Flag red-flag symptoms for escalation when needed.

## Daily cadence
- Morning check-in: within 15-90 minutes of wake.
- Midday check-in: around wake-day midpoint.
- Evening recap: end of day or 60-120 minutes pre-bed.
- If midday is missed, still complete evening recap.

## Weekly cadence
- Weekly review day:
- Calculate 7-day average adherence score.
- Review best day, worst day, and recurring friction.
- Confirm training volume and recovery balance.
- Set next week:
- Keep one behavior, cut one behavior, add one behavior.
- Set max three targets for next week.
- Escalation check:
- If persistent red flags or declining function despite adherence, escalate to clinician discussion.

## Fallback modes

### Busy day mode
- Keep three anchors:
- Sleep: caffeine cutoff + wind-down minimum.
- Nutrition: two protein feedings + hydration.
- Training: 20-minute movement block.
- Goal is minimum stability, not full optimization.

### Minimum viable day mode
- Absolute floor behavior set:
- Fixed wake window.
- Caffeine cutoff respected.
- 10-minute walk + one protein-forward meal.
- If the day breaks, complete this floor and count it as a kept streak day.

## Adherence scoring (simple points)
- Total score: `0-10` per day.
- Sleep score `0-4`:
- Wake window hit.
- Caffeine cutoff met.
- Last meal cutoff met.
- Wind-down plus sleep-environment target met.
- Nutrition score `0-3`:
- Protein anchors met.
- Hydration/salt and fueling consistency met.
- Whole-food pattern and seed-oil avoidance target met.
- Training score `0-3`:
- Planned training completed (or fallback completed).
- Daily movement baseline completed.
- Recovery block completed (mobility/breathing/downshift).

## Anti-all-or-nothing rules
- `6/10+` is a successful day.
- Missing one anchor does not void the day.
- Use salvage actions:
- Missed full training -> do fallback movement.
- Off-plan meal -> return to next planned meal, no compensation spiral.
- Late day stress spike -> run 10-minute downshift and protect wind-down.
- Never miss twice rule for primary habit of the week.
- Evaluate trends weekly, not emotionally in-day.
