# Coaching Integration Plan (Sleep + Nutrition + Training)

## Goal
- Replace sleep-only coaching with an integrated daily system.
- Keep prompts short, behavior-first, and easy to execute.
- Drive consistency, not perfection.

## Guiding rules
- Track three domains daily: sleep, nutrition, training.
- Prioritize adherence trend over single-day perfection.
- Run one primary behavior change at a time.
- Keep coaching language non-diagnostic and practical.

## Daily check-ins
- Morning check-in:
- Capture recovery state and set guardrails (caffeine cutoff, last meal cutoff, wind-down).
- Set nutrition anchors and training plan with fallback.
- Set one risk response and one non-negotiable.
- Midday check-in:
- Re-rate current state and confirm each domain is on track.
- Apply one sleep, one nutrition, and one training/recovery correction.
- Lock one accountability action by time.
- Evening recap:
- Score sleep, nutrition, training, and total.
- Capture what happened, what worked, friction, and one change for tomorrow.
- Flag red-flag symptoms for escalation when needed.

## Daily cadence
- Morning: within 15-90 minutes of wake.
- Midday: around wake-day midpoint.
- Evening: end of day or 60-120 minutes pre-bed.
- If midday is missed, still complete evening recap.

## Weekly cadence
- Calculate 7-day average domain and total scores.
- Review best day, lowest day, and recurring friction.
- Confirm training volume and recovery balance.
- Keep one behavior, cut one behavior, add one behavior.
- Set max three targets for next week.
- If persistent red flags or declining function despite adherence, escalate to clinician discussion.

## Fallback modes
- Busy day mode:
- Sleep: caffeine cutoff + wind-down minimum.
- Nutrition: two protein feedings + hydration.
- Training: 20-minute movement block.
- Minimum viable day mode:
- Fixed wake window.
- Caffeine cutoff respected.
- 10-minute walk + one protein-forward meal.

## Adherence scoring (only model)
- `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`
- Sleep `0-4` anchors:
- Wake window hit.
- Caffeine cutoff met.
- Last meal cutoff met.
- Wind-down + sleep-environment target met.
- Nutrition `0-3` anchors:
- Protein anchors met.
- Hydration/fueling consistency met.
- Whole-food pattern/seed-oil avoidance target met.
- Training `0-3` anchors:
- Planned training completed (or fallback completed).
- Daily movement baseline completed.
- Recovery block completed.

## Anti-all-or-nothing rules
- Operational floor: `6/10+` keeps continuity.
- Austin target: `7/10+` average (with push toward `8/10+`).
- Missing one anchor does not void the day.
- Use salvage actions instead of quitting the day.
- Evaluate trends weekly, not emotionally in-day.
