# Nutrition Testosterone Bible (Testosterone Kabbalah Snapshot)

## Scope
- Practical coaching reference distilled from `sources/testosterone-kabbalah/2026-02-20-fixmyt-testosterone-kabbalah-framework.html`.
- Use this for behavior coaching, habit design, and progress tracking.
- Do not use this as diagnosis or treatment protocol.

## Evidence label legend
- `article claim`: stated in the article snapshot; useful for coaching hypotheses but not automatically proven.
- `plausible mechanism`: biologically coherent and directionally reasonable, but evidence quality can be mixed.
- `strong clinical evidence`: supported by consistent human clinical evidence and widely accepted practice.

## Core model
- Testosterone is treated as a downstream output, not a direct lever. `article claim`
- Upstream layers drive downstream hormone expression: foundation -> organs -> interference hormones -> androgens. `article claim`
- Coaching priority is bottom-up repair before top-layer optimization. `plausible mechanism`
- Practical sequence:
- Stabilize sleep/wake rhythm and daily fuel.
- Improve digestion, liver load, and thyroid-supportive basics.
- Reduce chronic stress load and recovery debt.
- Reassess androgen outcomes after 4-8 weeks of adherence.

## Layer-by-layer nodes

### 1) Foundation layer
- Nutrition (fuel substrate):
- Adequate calories, protein, and carbohydrate support training output, sleep quality, and stress resilience. `strong clinical evidence`
- Extreme under-eating and chronic energy deficit suppress reproductive hormones. `strong clinical evidence`
- Seed-oil minimization can be a practical processed-food reduction rule, but avoid absolutist claims about all PUFA effects in every person. `plausible mechanism`
- Mitochondria/energy status:
- Poor sleep, low energy availability, and overreaching training reduce energy output and recovery capacity. `strong clinical evidence`
- Micronutrients (magnesium, B vitamins, iodine/selenium when deficient) matter mainly when intake is inadequate. `strong clinical evidence`

### 2) Organ layer
- Gut:
- GI distress, constipation/diarrhea, and high processed-food load can worsen adherence, inflammation burden, and recovery. `plausible mechanism`
- Coaching signal: bowel regularity, bloating, meal tolerance, appetite stability.
- Liver:
- Alcohol excess, poor sleep, and obesity increase metabolic burden and can worsen hormone balance. `strong clinical evidence`
- Coaching signal: alcohol frequency, late-night intake, waist trend, recovery trend.
- Thyroid/rate-setting:
- Low energy, cold intolerance, constipation, and persistent fatigue can overlap with thyroid issues, but symptoms are non-specific. `strong clinical evidence`
- Temperature/pulse trends can be useful coaching data, not diagnostic proof. `plausible mechanism`

### 3) Hormonal interference layer
- Cortisol/stress load:
- Sleep debt, under-fueling, and excessive stress can suppress reproductive signaling and training adaptation. `strong clinical evidence`
- Coaching signal: morning fatigue, stress reactivity, poor sleep continuity, persistent soreness.
- Serotonin/prolactin framing:
- The article places serotonin/prolactin as key suppressors; treat this as a working hypothesis, not a universal explanation. `article claim`
- High prolactin can suppress reproductive function; confirm clinically when suspected. `strong clinical evidence`

### 4) Androgen layer
- Estrogen/aromatase balance:
- Body-fat excess and metabolic dysfunction can worsen testosterone-to-estrogen balance. `strong clinical evidence`
- Progesterone in men:
- Relevant in steroid pathways, but routine optimization claims are often overstated in non-clinical coaching contexts. `plausible mechanism`
- DHT expression:
- Important androgen endpoint; avoid simplistic claims that higher is always better. `strong clinical evidence`
- Testosterone:
- Best interpreted with symptoms, sleep, energy, training performance, and longitudinal context, not one isolated lab draw. `strong clinical evidence`

## High-leverage coaching habits
- Fixed wake window (7 days/week, +/-30 minutes). `strong clinical evidence`
- Morning outdoor light and short walk within 60 minutes of waking. `strong clinical evidence`
- Protein anchor at 2-3 meals/day; avoid chronic under-eating. `strong clinical evidence`
- Place carbs around training and evening meal when sleep suffers from under-fueling. `plausible mechanism`
- Keep caffeine early; stop at least 8 hours before bed target bedtime. `strong clinical evidence`
- Keep last meal 2-3 hours pre-bed on most days. `strong clinical evidence`
- Train 3-5 days/week with progressive resistance; avoid daily maximal intensity. `strong clinical evidence`
- Add low-intensity movement daily (walks, steps, light cardio). `strong clinical evidence`
- Minimize alcohol and avoid binge patterns. `strong clinical evidence`
- Use simple food defaults: mostly whole foods, consistent hydration, adequate sodium for active days. `strong clinical evidence`

## Red flags for coaching escalation
- Persistent severe insomnia (>3 nights/week for >3 weeks).
- Witnessed apneas, choking/gasping, loud habitual snoring, or significant daytime sleepiness.
- Persistent erectile dysfunction, very low libido, or depressed mood despite 6-8 weeks of adherence.
- Unintentional weight loss, persistent GI bleeding, black stools, or severe abdominal pain.
- Symptoms of overtraining or burnout: resting HR trend up, persistent fatigue, performance drop for >2 weeks.
- Any suicidal thoughts, panic episodes, or major mood deterioration.

## What not to overclaim
- Do not promise testosterone increases by a fixed amount or timeline.
- Do not present one biomarker (temperature, pulse, one hormone lab) as diagnostic on its own.
- Do not frame any single food, supplement, or compound as a universal fix.
- Do not frame TRT as always wrong or always necessary; this is medical decision territory.
- Do not claim all low-carb diets always suppress hormones in every context.
- Do not imply serotonin/prolactin explanations replace proper clinical workup.

## Safety and scope limits
- This is educational coaching guidance, not medical advice.
- Medication, supplement dosing, endocrine conditions, and lab interpretation beyond behavior tracking require a licensed clinician.
- Escalate to clinician when red flags persist, when function is declining despite adherence, or when symptoms suggest endocrine/sleep-disordered breathing issues.

## Austin default protocol (behavior-first)

### Daily
- Morning:
- Wake in fixed window.
- Get 10-20 minutes outdoor light and 5-10 minutes easy movement.
- Eat first protein-forward meal within 60-90 minutes.
- Set training tier for the day: full session / short session / minimum viable.
- Midday:
- Hit second protein feeding and hydration target.
- Complete planned training or fallback movement block.
- Reconfirm caffeine cutoff and evening meal timing.
- Evening:
- Last meal 2-3 hours before bed when possible.
- Start 45-60 minute wind-down.
- Keep room cool, dark, and quiet.
- Set next-day wake alarm and one next-day non-negotiable.

### Weekly
- Resistance training: 3 sessions/week.
- Conditioning: 2 low-intensity sessions/week (walk, bike, incline walk, easy jog).
- Recovery: 1 lighter day with mobility and sleep focus.
- Nutrition prep: 1 planning block (groceries, protein prep, simple carb options).
- Review: 1 weekly recap with score trends, friction points, and one adjustment for next week.
- Rule: change one primary lever per week, not five at once.
