# Austin Goal Setup v1 (2026-02-20)

## Non-negotiables
- Caffeine: before noon only.
- Last calories: by 7:00pm daily.
- Pre-swim nights (Sun/Tue/Thu): lights out 10:00pm.

## Weekly structure
- Mon: swim (early).
- Tue: strength (Greyskull/Phrak A).
- Wed: swim (early).
- Thu: strength (Greyskull/Phrak B, moderate).
- Fri: swim (early).
- Sat: strength (Greyskull/Phrak C) or shortened lift if masters swim happens.
- Sun: rest + light yoga + walk.

## Strength vs HIIT decision
- Primary path: Greyskull/Phrak 3x/week for progressive overload and measurable strength gains.
- HIIT ab circuit is fallback/finisher, not primary replacement.

## Standard training mode enum (use everywhere)
- `Gym LP` (`Train:GymLP`)
- `Home Strength (KB+Pullup+Rings)` (`Train:HomeStrength`)
- `HIIT Only (Chris Heria style)` (`Train:HIITOnly`)
- `Minimum Day` (`Train:MinimumDay`)
- `Recovery` (`Train:Recovery`)

## Fallback ladder (A/B/C)
- `A = Home Strength 25-35 min`
- `B = HIIT 10-15 min`
- `C = Minimum Day 8-12 min`

## Pre-swim-night training guidance (Sun/Tue/Thu)
- Avoid late hard HIIT on pre-swim nights.
- If evening is tight, favor `A` or `C` over forcing a hard session.

## Walk floor
- 20-minute walk is enough as a minimum floor.
- Progression target: average 25-35 minutes/day or 7k-9k steps/day over 2-4 weeks.

## Interference management (swim + lift)
- Keep hard lift volume moderate on Tue/Thu to protect Thu/Fri sleep and swim quality.
- Avoid maximal grinding before pre-swim nights.
- Finish hard training at least 3-4 hours before bedtime when possible.
- If recovery drops for 2+ days, cut lift volume ~30% for 48h, then resume.

## 14-day progression rules
- Week 1: conservative loads, hit all sessions, protect sleep timing.
- Week 2: if form/reps are solid, add +2.5-5 lb upper and +5-10 lb lower where appropriate.
- If form breaks twice on a lift, reduce ~10% next exposure and rebuild.

## Modifier rollout (coaching only, not scored)
- Daily capture in morning/midday/evening:
- Recovery readiness (Green/Yellow/Red) + energy.
- Stress (1-5) + 10-minute reset completed/planned.
- Hydration sufficiency (urine color + 1L by noon yes/no).
- Meaningful social connection (10+ minutes yes/no).
- Risk/safety (pain 0-10 + location + red-flag symptom yes/no).

## Modifier trigger rules
- Readiness Yellow threshold: Yellow >=2 consecutive check-ins or energy <=2 -> fallback training + bedtime protection for 24h.
- Readiness Red threshold: any Red or energy =1 -> recovery-only day (no high intensity).
- Stress threshold: stress >=4 -> 10-minute reset within 60 minutes.
- Hydration misses: dark urine or missed 1L by noon; if >=2 days/week -> lock AM + pre-noon hydration blocks.
- Connection misses: no 10+ minute connection for 2 consecutive days -> schedule next-day connection block before 6pm.
- Pain/red-flag escalation: red-flag yes or pain >=7 -> urgent escalation now; pain 4-6 for >48h (or pain >=3 for 3+ days) -> clinician-soon.

## Daily adherence score (only model)
- `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`
- Sleep `0-4`:
- Wake window hit.
- Caffeine before noon.
- Last calories by 7:00pm.
- Pre-swim-night lights-out target hit (or standard wind-down target on other nights).
- Nutrition `0-3`:
- Protein anchors hit.
- Hydration/fueling consistency hit.
- Whole-food pattern/seed-oil avoidance target hit.
- Training `0-3`:
- Planned session completed (or fallback `A/B/C` completed).
- Movement floor met (>=20 min walk).
- Recovery block completed (5-10 min mobility/breathing).

## Targets
- Week 1: average >=7/10.
- Week 2: average >=8/10.
- Rule: never miss the same key habit twice.

## Source confidence summary
- High: weekly activity minimums, strength training superiority for strength gain, consistency effects.
- Moderate-high: concurrent training interference management via spacing and fatigue control.
- Moderate-high: caffeine timing effects on sleep.
- Moderate: evening intense exercise can impair sleep in some people.
- Low-moderate: strict universal 7:00pm calorie cutoff effects (used here as behavior structure).
