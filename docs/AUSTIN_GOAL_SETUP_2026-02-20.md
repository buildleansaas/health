# Austin Goal Setup v1 (2026-02-20)

## Non-negotiables
- Caffeine: before noon only.
- Last calories: by 7:00pm daily.
- Pre-swim nights (Sun/Tue/Thu): lights out 10:00pm.

## Weekly structure
- Mon: swim (early).
- Tue: strength (Greyskull/Phrak A).
- Wed: swim (early).
- Thu: strength (Greyskull/Phrak B, moderate).
- Fri: swim (early).
- Sat: strength (Greyskull/Phrak C) OR shortened lift if masters swim happens.
- Sun: rest + light yoga + walk.

## Strength vs HIIT decision
- Primary path: Greyskull/Phrak 3x/week for progressive overload and measurable strength gains.
- HIIT ab circuit (Chris Heria style) is fallback/finisher, not primary replacement.

## Walk floor
- 20-minute walk is enough as a minimum floor.
- Target progression: average 25-35 minutes/day or 7k-9k steps/day over 2-4 weeks.

## Interference management (swim + lift)
- Keep hard lift volume moderate on Tue/Thu to protect Thu/Fri sleep and swim quality.
- Avoid maximal grinding before pre-swim nights.
- Finish hard training at least 3-4 hours before bedtime when possible.
- If recovery drops for 2+ days, cut lift volume ~30% for 48h, then resume.

## 14-day progression rules
- Week 1: conservative loads, hit all sessions, protect sleep timing.
- Week 2: if form/reps are solid, add +2.5-5 lb upper and +5-10 lb lower where appropriate.
- If form breaks twice on a lift, reduce ~10% next exposure and rebuild.

## Daily adherence score (0-10)
- 3 pts: planned main session completed (or Sunday planned recovery).
- 2 pts: sleep timing hit (10:00pm on Sun/Tue/Thu).
- 2 pts: movement floor met (>=20 min walk).
- 2 pts: nutrition timing hit (caffeine pre-noon + last calories <=7:00pm).
- 1 pt: recovery block (5-10 min mobility/breathing).

## Targets
- Week 1: average >=7/10.
- Week 2: average >=8/10.
- Rule: never miss the same key habit twice.

## Source confidence summary
- High: weekly activity minimums, strength training superiority for strength gain, consistency effects.
- Moderate-high: concurrent training interference management via session spacing and fatigue control.
- Moderate-high: caffeine timing effects on sleep.
- Moderate: evening intense exercise can impair sleep in some people.
- Low-moderate: strict universal 7:00pm calorie cutoff effects (used here as behavior structure).
