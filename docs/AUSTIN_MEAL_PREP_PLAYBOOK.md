# Austin Meal Prep Playbook (2026-02-21)

## Objective
- Execute breakfast + lunch in town with low friction.
- Prioritize no-microwave options while using fridge access.
- Protect behavior-first testosterone basics: sleep consistency, fuel timing, stress stability, recovery quality.

## Weekly rhythm split
- `MWF`:
- Up early -> masters swim -> work in town -> home for dinner.
- Highest risk: skipping breakfast after swim, then grabbing random lunch.
- `Tue/Thu`:
- Up later -> work in town -> short break -> pool work -> home around `7:30pm`.
- Highest risk: long gap between lunch and pool block causing low energy and fast-food drift.

## Breakfast and lunch strategy by day type
- `MWF breakfast`:
- Default to planned post-swim fast-food breakfast in town (not packed reheated meals).
- Primary default: CFA chicken/egg/hash brown burrito meal + 3 jalapeño salsa packs + fruit + large Coke.
- Secondary default: McD BOGO sausage, egg & cheese McGriddles + strawberry jelly on each + large Coke.
- Eat within `60-90` minutes post-swim.
- `MWF lunch`:
- Pre-pack no-microwave meal on Sunday + Wednesday night.
- Keep one shelf-stable backup in bag (jerky/protein shake/oats cup).
- `Tue/Thu breakfast`:
- Eat at home or in car before first work block; no skipped breakfast days.
- Keep prep under 5 minutes: yogurt bowl, egg wrap, or shake + banana.
- `Tue/Thu lunch`:
- Eat by early afternoon to avoid pool-session under-fueling.
- Add pre-pool snack if lunch is >4 hours before pool work.

Breakfast bake placement:
- Use breakfast bake primarily for home meals (lunch/dinner) and backup meals, not default MWF post-swim breakfast.

## No-microwave portable meal ideas
- Greek yogurt cup + berries + granola.
- Cottage cheese cup + pineapple + almonds.
- Turkey wrap (Mission Carb Balance tortilla, spinach, mustard, optional cheese) + apple.
- Rotisserie chicken sandwich (whole grain bread) + carrots.
- Turkey + cheese roll-ups + carrot/cucumber box.
- Chicken salad with chickpeas + mixed greens + vinaigrette.
- Hard-boiled eggs (2-3) + fruit + string cheese.
- Overnight oats (protein powder + chia + milk) + banana.
- Protein shake + peanut butter sandwich + fruit.
- Bento box: deli turkey, cheese cubes, grapes, baby carrots, hummus.
- Quinoa salad jar (quinoa, chicken, black beans, peppers, lime).
- Smoked salmon bagel thin + light cream cheese + tomato.

## Wrap formula (standard)
- Tortilla: Mission Carb Balance (primary), Tumaro's (backup), otherwise smallest whole-wheat with >=3g fiber.
- Fill: 6-8 oz protein + spinach + mustard + optional cheese.
- Sauerkraut: use with home bowls/plates, not wraps.
- Optional calorie add: cheese.

## Fast-food fallback matrix (Mechanicsville)
- `Chick-fil-A`:
- Order (Austin default): chicken/egg/hash brown burrito meal + 3 jalapeño salsa packs + fruit + large Coke.
- Keep it on-plan: skip extra add-ons beyond this meal.
- Optional step-down (performance days): medium Coke or Coke Zero.
- `McDonald's`:
- Order (Austin default): BOGO sausage, egg & cheese McGriddles + strawberry jelly on each + large Coke.
- Keep it on-plan: no extra fries/desserts on top.
- Optional step-down (performance days): medium Coke or Coke Zero.
- `Chipotle`:
- Order (Austin default): bowl with white rice, black beans, double chicken, fajitas, pico, corn, sour cream, cheese.
- Keep it on-plan: avoid adding chips/queso/drink on top unless intentional.
- Optional step-down (when desired): single chicken or no sour cream.
- `Taco Bell`:
- Order (Austin default): 2 Cheesy Gordita Crunches + large Pepsi.
- Keep it on-plan: avoid adding extra sides/desserts on top.

## Simple fallback rules
- Always anchor protein first.
- Add produce second.
- Add carbs based on training demand (higher on swim/lift days, moderate on lighter days).
- Keep drinks intentional (planned large Coke is acceptable for MWF breakfast; avoid stacking extra sugary drinks later).
- If order is uncertain, use: lean protein + fruit/veg + one planned drink.

## Traffic-proof defaults
- If no prep time in morning: grab protein shake + banana + cheese stick and leave.
- If lunch window collapses: execute nearest fallback chain using "protein-first" order.
- If stuck between meetings: eat packed backup snack now, then full meal at next break.
- If pool block is within 90 minutes: use light carb + protein snack, then normal dinner at home.
- If Tue/Thu commute will push dinner late: use a pre-drive meal/snack before `7:00pm`; if missed, keep home meal simple and log guardrail miss without spiraling.

## Grocery shortlist
- Proteins: rotisserie chicken, deli turkey, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, protein powder.
- Carbs: oats, whole grain wraps/bread, rice cups, quinoa, fruit (bananas, apples, berries), potatoes, sweet potatoes.
- Produce: spinach/mixed greens, carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, frozen steam veg.
- Fats/extras: natural peanut butter, olive oil, hummus, salsa, mustard, sauerkraut.
- Convenience backups: jerky, protein bars, shelf-stable shakes, cheese sticks.

## 60-90 minute prep block (Sunday, optional 20-30 minute Wednesday reset)
- `0-10 min`: choose 3 breakfasts + 3 lunches for next 3 workdays.
- `10-30 min`: batch protein (eggs, chicken, turkey portions).
- `30-50 min`: prep carbs (overnight oats jars, quinoa/rice portions).
- `50-70 min`: wash/chop produce, build grab-and-go boxes.
- `70-90 min`: pack MWF and Tue/Thu day kits (meal + snack + water plan), restock car/work bag backups.

## Good / Better / Best decision ladder
- `Good`: no skipped breakfast/lunch; any protein-forward option + water.
- `Better`: planned meal timing + protein + produce, plus backup snack packed.
- `Best`: prepped breakfast/lunch matched to day type, no-microwave execution, and one fast-food fallback used only as planned.

## Meal logistics adherence (tracking only, no score change)
- Track daily:
- Breakfast executed as planned (`Yes/Partial/No`).
- Lunch executed as planned (`Yes/Partial/No`).
- No-microwave preference honored (`Yes/No`, with reason if `No`).
- Fast-food fallback used intentionally vs impulsively (`Intentional/Impulsive/None`).
- Use this to drive coaching prompts and adjustments only; keep score formula unchanged.
