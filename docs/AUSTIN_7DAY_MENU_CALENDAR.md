# Austin 7-Day Menu Calendar (v3)

## Macro targets by day (recomp baseline at 225 lbs, 6'3")
- Mon (Masters + town work): **2850 kcal** — **P220 / C320 / F90**
- Tue (Town + pool shift): **2700 kcal** — **P220 / C270 / F95**
- Wed (Masters + town work): **2850 kcal** — **P220 / C320 / F90**
- Thu (Town + pool shift): **2700 kcal** — **P220 / C270 / F95**
- Fri (Masters + town work): **2850 kcal** — **P220 / C320 / F90**
- Sat (Strength/home): **2800 kcal** — **P220 / C300 / F90**
- Sun (Recovery): **2500 kcal** — **P210 / C220 / F95**

Scoring model unchanged: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

Raw milk integration:
- Assume `1 gallon/week` raw whole milk (`16 cups/week`, ~`2.3 cups/day` average).
- Macro block from milk (weekly): ~`+128g protein / +192g carbs / +128g fat` (~`+2,380 kcal`).
- Daily planning rule: when milk intake is higher, reduce one carb add-on + one fat add-on to stay near daily targets.

## Prep flow (Sunday 60-90 min)
1. Batch cook breakfast bake (6 containers).
2. Cook chicken + rice/quinoa for 4-5 lunches.
3. Build grab-and-go snack kits.
4. Pack MWF breakfast/lunch kits and Tue/Thu lunch backups.
5. Wednesday night: 20-30 min restock.

## Notes
- MWF reality rule: breakfast defaults to fast-food post-masters (planned, not random). Breakfast bake is primarily a home lunch/dinner tool.
- Body-comp intent: hold near 225 while improving definition first; only push toward 230-240 after waist trend is stable and training performance is rising.
- If bodyweight is trending down too fast (>1 lb/week), increase carbs +150-200 kcal/day.
- If trending up too fast (>1 lb/week), reduce carbs/fats by 150-200 kcal/day.
