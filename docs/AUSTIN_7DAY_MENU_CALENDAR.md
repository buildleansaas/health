# Austin 7-Day Menu Calendar (v2)

## Macro targets by day
- Mon (Masters + town work): **2600 kcal** — **P190 / C290 / F80**
- Tue (Town + pool shift): **2450 kcal** — **P185 / C250 / F85**
- Wed (Masters + town work): **2600 kcal** — **P190 / C290 / F80**

- Sat (Strength/home): **2550 kcal** — **P190 / C270 / F85**
- Sun (Recovery): **2250 kcal** — **P180 / C180 / F85**

Scoring model unchanged: `total 0-10 = sleep 0-4 + nutrition 0-3 + training 0-3`.

Raw milk integration:
- Assume `1 gallon/week` raw whole milk (`16 cups/week`, ~`2.3 cups/day` average).
- Macro block from milk (weekly): ~`+128g protein / +192g carbs / +128g fat` (~`+2,380 kcal`).
- Daily planning rule: when milk intake is higher, reduce one carb add-on + one fat add-on to stay near daily targets.

- If bodyweight is trending down too fast (>1 lb/week), increase carbs +150-200 kcal/day.
- If trending up too fast (>1 lb/week), reduce carbs/fats by 150-200 kcal/day.
