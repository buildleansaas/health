# Health Sleep System Repo

This repo is a practical, evidence-informed sleep coaching package for Austin.
It turns a social-media "sleep bible" thread into a clear system you can run daily.

## What’s inside

- `reports/2026-02-19-sleep-bible.md`
  - Full coaching report: system, 14-day plan, checklist, claims audit, supplement cautions, and personalization questions.
- `templates/daily-scorecard.md`
  - Copy/paste daily tracker to keep execution honest.
- `templates/weekly-review.md`
  - Weekly reflection template to adjust the plan fast.

## How to use this repo

1. Read `reports/2026-02-19-sleep-bible.md` once end-to-end.
2. Pick a target wake time and bedtime window.
3. Use `templates/daily-scorecard.md` every day for 14 days.
4. Run `templates/weekly-review.md` at the end of each week.
5. Personalize using the “What I need from Austin” questions in the report.

## Notes

- This is coaching material, not medical advice.
- If there are red flags (loud snoring, gasping, severe daytime sleepiness, insomnia lasting months), escalate to a licensed clinician and consider a sleep medicine referral.
